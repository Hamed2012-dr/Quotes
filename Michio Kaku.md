- The greatest destroyer of scientist is junior high school. Every day we lose hundreds of thousands of junior high school kids who think the scientist is boring and useless memorizing facts and figures thet never gonna use again.
- Physics not only unlocked the secrets of the universe, it also predicts the future.
- That's what we physicists do, we invent the future.
- I would rather work on one big problem and fail than work on lots of little problems and succeed.
